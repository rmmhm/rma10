MongoDB is a NoSQL Document Database, meaning it is not stored in traditional rows+columns
rather as a collection of documents

A document is a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs
A field is a unique identifier for a datapoint
A value is a data related to a given identifier
A collection is a organized store of documents, with common fields between documents

Atlas - cloud service for MongoDB
      - deploys clusters, a group of servers that stores data
Clusters form replica sets, connected servers that store the same data
An instance is a single machine locally or in the cloud running a certain software

Name of a cluster cannot be changed after creation.
