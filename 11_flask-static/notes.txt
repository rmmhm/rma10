K11 -- Some Things Never Change: doin' flask but with html (and totally some css too)
2020-10-13

Our Predictions:
-HOPEFULLY it functions, but we could end up with an error

After The Fact:
So, it downloads a copy of foo, which is cool, but not really the intended effect.
However, when we run foo.html, flask hosts it as a website! Woohoo!
This means that we could host other things, like fancypants projects...
