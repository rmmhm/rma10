Aggregation framework
  .aggregate() takes in an array and works like a pipeline
  {$match: {"amenities":"Wifi"}}, filters out files that don't have Wifi as an amenity
  {$project: {"price": 1, "address": 1, "_id": 0}}, show only the price and address and exclude the id
  $group takes in a stream of data and puts it into different distinct reservoirs
    {$group:
      {
        _id: "$address.country", // Group By Expression
        <field1>: {<accumulator1> : <expression1>},
        ...
      }}
    groups all of the files with the same country into one file
  .sort() is a cursor method
    .find().sort()
  .limit() sorts to a certain number of results
  indexes to speed up queries
    .createIndex({"birth year": 1}) creates an index based on birth year
  upsert, update and insert, default is false
    if there is a match, then update, if not, insert
