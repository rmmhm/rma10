1 - generates an alert for the cell that was clicked
2 - generates an alert for the cell that was clicked, then the row that contains the cell, then the entire table
3 - generates an alert for the entire table, then the cell that was clicked, then the row that contains the cell
4 - generates an alert for the entire table, then the row that contains the cell, then the cell that was clicked

if e.stopPropagation(); is uncommented, only the first alert would pop up.

the order that the event listeners are attached does not matter - the alerts still show up in the same order

"var table = document.getElementsByTagName('table')[0];"
- importance of the indexing (?)
