K14 -- Form and Function - using post/get forms in flask
2020-12-10

To access form data from login.html, request.form is used.
It references the dictionary created from the form in login.html.


The post method is much more secure than the get method.
The get method shows the dictionary values in the url.

If the get method is used it's possible to
    retrieve an exact response by inputting a specific link
    reload the page without any errors
The post method requires a resubmission of the username each time to access the response.
