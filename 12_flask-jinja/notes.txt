Notes:
-okay so we're having issues getting the template file to run, we can't seem to
figure out why. (Not Found error)
DEBUGGING LIST:
- We put working code in the same area, but it still returned not found.
- We moved template file out
(we eventually found it because we didn't grab the right app.py file, rip)

Q0: When we removed render_template... it worked? This seems like an issue on
our side, but maybe it's just 100% useless. :P

Q1: nope we definitely cannot, this was what took us a while, because I forgot
how to read app.route

Q2: First, model_tmplt.html is the name of the file we're grabbing! Then it looks like
the foooooooooooooooo appears as the name of the site. And finally, coll is that array
hiding in plain sight. Now, what all of these do is they seem to act as arguments!
We have a foo variable and a coll variable in the model_tmplt file, and it seems that
they take on the values given by app.py.
very interesting indeed...
