Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?
This be lookin a lot like Python chief, although we did notice what we suspected was Java-like typecasting

Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
In the terminal, it's the start of a file path! Since there is no path currently, maybe we'll just stay in this directory?

Q2: Where will this print to? Q2.5: What will it print?
Our best guess is the terminal, because when you run stuff, it does generally tend to print in the terminal
As for what it will print, our primary guess is the name of the current module (after some non-Stack Overflow research)

POST-RUNNING: Surprise! It's a webpage with "No hablo queso!" on it! And it turns out the print statement didn't appear anywhere... but the queso did!

Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
The return command in python tends to require you to then print the output, so we don't think it will appear.
We can't say for sure since none of us have used apps before!

POST-RUNNING: Well, it looks like things that get returned end up on the page!

Q4: Where have you seen similar construcs in other languages?
Java! I guess Arduino?
